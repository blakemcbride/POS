Portable Objects for Scheme
======================

POS is a portable object system for Scheme. It offers the following features:

1. It is very portable

    Only uses R5RS standard facilities including define-syntax/syntax-rules

2. Very small

    Consists of only 1 constant, 1 function and 1 macro

3. Supports the following OO features

  * multiple inheritance
  * class and instance variables and methods
  * strong instance and class variable encapsulation
  * very easy instance variable access from within methods
  * very simple to use
  * no MOP but some reflection

4. Open source and freely available

Source code for this system is available at:  [https://github.com/blakemcbride/POS](https://github.com/blakemcbride/POS)
